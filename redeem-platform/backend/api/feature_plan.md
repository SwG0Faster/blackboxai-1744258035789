# Feature Plan for Redeem Platform

## New Features to Implement

1. **Enhanced Filtering for Redeem Codes**
   - **Objective**: Allow users to filter redeem codes by additional criteria such as expiry date and verification status.
   - **Changes**:
     - Update the `get_queryset` method in `RedeemCodeViewSet` to include filters for `expiry_date` and `is_verified`.

2. **Transaction History Endpoint**
   - **Objective**: Provide users with a history of their transactions, including details of each transaction.
   - **Changes**:
     - Create a new endpoint in `TransactionViewSet` to retrieve transaction history for the authenticated user.

3. **User Profile Update Feature**
   - **Objective**: Allow users to update their profile information, such as phone number and balance.
   - **Changes**:
     - Add a new method in `UserProfileViewSet` to handle profile updates.

4. **Activity Log for Users**
   - **Objective**: Track user activity, such as purchases and sales, and provide an endpoint to retrieve this log.
   - **Changes**:
     - Create a new model for activity logs and a corresponding serializer.
     - Implement a new view to retrieve the activity log for the authenticated user.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update `views.py` to implement the new endpoints and methods.
2. Modify `models.py` to add any new models or fields required for the features.
3. Update `serializers.py` to include new validation and serialization logic for the new features.
4. Test the new features to ensure they work as expected.

## Rationale
These features will enhance the user experience by providing more functionality and better data management, making the platform more robust and user-friendly.
